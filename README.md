This program is used to make operations on matrices up to order 100x100. Operations are Adding(Enter +), subtract(Enter -), multiply(Enter -), power(Enter ^), transpose(Enter T), determinant(Enter D), inverse(Enter I) ande divide(Enter /).
the program also support complex numbers. It useful for solving electrical circuits that contain energy storage elements with AC power sources and helps civil engineers
to calculate the moment from complex matrices.
